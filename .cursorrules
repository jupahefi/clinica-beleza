# Cursor Rules for Cl√≠nica Belleza Project

## Core Development Principles

### Execution & Testing
- NEVER execute commands or scripts - user is responsible for deployment and testing
- NEVER attempt to run bash commands on local environment
- User is solely responsible for deployment and testing

### Error Handling & Logging
- NEVER use console.log - use toast notifications instead
- ALWAYS propagate native database errors to backend and frontend
- Propagate JavaScript errors when appropriate
- Use descriptive logging: MySQL and JavaScript engines provide descriptive logs
- When errors originate from database, display raw DB error for maximum descriptiveness

### Development Approach
- NEVER develop things halfway - complete implementations only
- NEVER make unsolicited code changes or remove functions not explicitly requested
- Ask for clarification on business rules instead of inventing them
- NEVER use fallbacks. The only fallback that exists is for the error handling wrapper. No more fallback than that.

### Architecture
- All business logic in database: database centralized + API passthrough
- All SQL logic MUST be implemented in stored procedures (SPs)
- Direct SQL statements in code are NOT allowed
- Every stored procedure MUST generate logs for audit history

### Data Management
- NO delete operations allowed - only soft deletions
- Tables requiring soft deletion MUST have an 'estado' column
- For sales, 'estado' field has two values: 'pendiente pago' and 'pagada'
- Zero-cost sales default to 'pagada'

### Security
- Passwords MUST be hashed using bcrypt
- Backend must perform hashing when receiving passwords
